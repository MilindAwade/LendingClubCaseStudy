## Lending Club Case Study ##
 
## Problem Statement
You work for a consumer finance company that specializes in offering various types of loans to urban customers. When a loan application is submitted, the company must decide whether to approve it based on the applicant's profile. This decision involves two potential risks:

1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, rejecting the application leads to a missed business opportunity for the company.
2. If the applicant is likely to default, approving the loan could result in a financial loss for the company.

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate how consumer characteristics and loan features impact the likelihood of loan default.

## Constraints
When an individual applies for a loan, the company can make one of two decisions:

Loan Approved: If the loan is approved, there are three possible outcomes:
- Fully Paid: The applicant has repaid the loan in full, including both principal and interest.
- Current: The applicant is actively repaying the loan, and the loan term has not yet concluded. These applicants are not considered to have defaulted.
- Charged-Off: The applicant has failed to make timely payments for an extended period, resulting in a loan default.

Loan Rejected: The company declines the loan application (due to not meeting certain criteria, etc). Since these applicants did not receive a loan, no transaction history exists for them with the company, and thus, this data is not included in the dataset.
